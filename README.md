# Tutorial: Instructions for Creating a small Openshift API  catalog in 3scale. 

## Introduction
This tutorial draws on two 3scale Repos: 
1) [3scale CLI](https://github.com/3scale/3scale-cli)  
2) [API discovery](https://github.com/3scale/3scale-discover-APIs)    
For now this is non core functionality to 3scale but shortly we will be significantly enhancing our support for this area in the product. 
We will be constantly evolving this tutorial but for now we will import 4 OAI (Swagger) specs into 3scale - each of which will form an element of our catalog.  

## Steps
##### 1 - Import 4 OAI specs into 3scale.
##### 2 - Add our catalog files to our 3scale Developer Portal.
##### 3 - Modify our catalog files to reflect our API specs.
##### 4 - Test our catalog.  


## 1 - Import 4 OAI specs into 3scale.
Go to the [3scale CLI](https://github.com/3scale/3scale-cli)
